## Submission guideline

Recap on submission process:
1) **ONLY** the original Driver should submit the project (REPEAT: do not submit twice if working in a pair!)
2) Add a README to your project that includes the two student's full names
3) Make sure to publish your project to Github Pages, either using the web interface or creating a `gh-pages` branch
4) Provide the link to the live app in the README (it will always be `https://thinkful-ei-bee.github.io/[repo-name]` ) (edited)
